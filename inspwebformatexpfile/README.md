experimenting with website formating inspired by nikolatosicpoetry
in correspondace with Dr Karen Ann Donnachie, i found that the file that I was using to format my experimentations was a wordpress-css file
At my current skill level I was unable to use this to a reasonable skill level, that I could apply it in my own designs
I insted ventured to appply aspects of this format in my designs going forward
